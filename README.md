**Preferred Name:** Clifford



### About/Overview

Give a general overview of the problem and how your program solve the problem



### List of Features

List all features that are present in your program.



### How to Run

Describe how to run your program from the JAR file. Describe what arguments are needed (if any) and what they mean.

Go to the res folder and run the command java -jar jar.jar clinicfile.txt. The argument clinicfile.txt is the input
file with the clinic information that the model is supposed to read. The output will be the same as the example run.


### How to Use the Program

Provide instructions on how to use the functionality in your program. If it is interactive, describe how to interact with your program. Pay particular attention to the parts that are not part of the example runs that you provide.



### Example Runs

List any example runs that you have in res/ directory and provide a description of what each example represents or does. Make sure that your example runs are provided as *plain text files*.

examplerun.txt is in my res directory and goes through all of the Clinic functions and how they interact with staff and patients. The output should be:

### Design/Model Changes

Document what changes you have made from earlier designs. Why did you make those changes? Keep an on-going list using some form of versioning so it is clear when these changes occurred.



### Assumptions

List any assumptions that you made during program development and implementations. Be sure that these do not conflict with the requirements of the project.



### Limitations

What limitations exist in your program. This should include any requirements that were *not* implemented or were not working correctly (including something that might work some of the time).



### Citations

Be sure to cite your sources. A good guideline is if you take more than three lines of code from some source, you must include the information on where it came from. Citations should use proper [IEEE citation guidelines](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE Citation Guidelines.pdf) and should include references (websites, papers, books, or other) for ***any site that you used to research a solution***. For websites, this includes name of website, title of the article, the url, and the date of retrieval**.** Citations should also include a qualitative description of what you used, and what you changed/contributed.
